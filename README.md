## Hi my name is Gael Sanchez ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a degree in AI and Data Science at the Universidad de Guadalajara (UDG)
At this moment my focus is on improving my Python skills and exploring various machine learning technologies.
I'm also interested in Generative AI, databases and advanced topics related to my field.
Always eager to learn and expand my knowledge.
